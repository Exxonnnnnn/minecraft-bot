# Version 2.1.1

Hi everyone! Time for a quick revision of 2.1! This revison marks an important milestone. We had our first pull request! @MarcoD1337 (who also assisted in fixing wokcommand issues) made a pull request that added colored circles to the status command, instead of text!

## Bot Updates
- Replaced the text in the `status` command with colored circles (#1)
- WOKCommands has been fixed, and is now in use
- Changed the bot status
- The list of colaborators can now be found on the `about` command
- Fixed the `ping` command

## Development Updates
- Added a `.vscode` folder for debugging
- Most WOKCommands parameters are now in the `message` parameter for some reason.
- Added `partials` to the Discord client.

Hi everyone! It's really been awhile since I last updated this bot. In fact, the last update to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/The0Show/minecraft-bot) was on January 7th, 2021! Well, I'm back, and we have a very minor update for everyone. 2.1 mainly updates behind-the-scenes stuff, so you probably won't notice any differences. Before we get to the changes, I just want to apologize for the horrible uptime I've been giving to you all. I run most of my Discord bots on my PC, so it sometimes slows down, which makes me close the CMD window. But, I'm starting to move my bots over to a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu Server, with Minecraft Bot being the first bot to be transferred. Hopefully, this change can help supply better uptime for the bot, and a more enjoyable experience for you all :smile:. Now, onto the changes!

- No more `botsettings.json` :tada: (`.env` is cooler)
- Moved all of the commands into the callback, and just made the callback async
- Embeds have been migrated from JSON data to `MessageEmbed`
- Removed the 2b2t "seen" command, since "stats" gives that info already

That's the entire update. Hopefully in the future we'll have a bigger update with more new features for you all to play around with! If you have any issues or suggestions, feel free to [create an issue on the GitHub](https://github.com/The0Show/minecraft-bot/issues), or [join my Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZSn3cHP). I'll see you next time, with version 2.2!
